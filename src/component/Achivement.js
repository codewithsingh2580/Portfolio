            my cricket journey. I took **8 wickets in a single match**, earning
            the **Man of the Match** award and a brand-new cricket ball 🏏. It
            wasn’t just a prize; it was a reminder of my hard work and passion.
            That day, I learned that **dedication and perseverance always lead
            to success**."
